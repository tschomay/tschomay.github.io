Hello! My name is Ted Schomay and I am a PhD student in Bioengineering at the University of Utah. My research is on developing mathematical frameworks to find patterns in big datasets. I use these methods to analyze genome-scale profiles of cancer patients in search of better prognostic tests. My passions lie in leveraging hard sciences and mathematics to make discoveries from data that benefit humanity. This page is currently under development, so check back often to see what's new!
