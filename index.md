## Welcome
<img align="right" src="/assets/images/Ted.jpg" height="202" width="200">
Hello! My name is Ted Schomay and I am a PhD student in Bioengineering at the University of Utah. My research is on developing mathematical frameworks to find patterns in big datasets. I use these methods to analyze genome-scale profiles of cancer patients in search of better prognostic tests.

## Research
My research lies at the intersection of math and computational biology.

#### Mathematics
I have mathematically defined and proved the properties of novel methods for the simultaneous decomposition of two or more data tensors (multi-way arrays). These methods build on the singular value decomposition (SVD). Given a dataset of two or more tensors that are dimension-matches on all axes except for one, these methods allow us to find sets of basis vectors that are shared among the matched dimensions of the tensors. These basis vectors (or patterns across each dimension) contain fundamental information abou the dataset. With the overall structure of the decomposition, we can interpret patterns that are common between all the tensors in the decomposition or unique to only some. We can also use the generalizations of the singular values to determine the importance of each pattern in the dataset.

#### Computation Biology
DNA copy-number aberrations (CNAs) are a well known hallmark of cancer. However, their exact function is not well understood. We use our mathematical decompositions to uncover patterns of CNAs that predict patient prognosis. These genomic-based prognostic indicators could influence patient treatment and potentially contain insight into the progression of the disease. 

## Interests
As my current research indicates, I am interested in approaching biomedical problems from a rigorous scientific standpoint. I believe that the key to closing the many gaps in our knowledge of biology and medicine will come from applying logic and methodology from other sciences and engineering. With our modern ability to collect large-scale data from biological systems, I think key advancements will come from machine learning methods and discovery from data. My primary interest is in continuing to push our ability to make discoveries from data and applying these methods to issues at the forefront of modern needs.
