## Welcome
|Hello! My name is Ted Schomay and I am a PhD student in Bioengineering at the University of Utah. My research is on developing mathematical frameworks to find patterns in big datasets. I use these methods to analyze genome-scale profiles of cancer patients in search of better prognostic tests. | ![Ted](/assets/images/Ted.jpg) |
