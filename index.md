## Welcome
|<p style="text-align: justify;"> Hello! My name is Ted Schomay and I am a PhD student in Bioengineering at the University of Utah. My research is on developing mathematical frameworks to find patterns in big datasets. I use these methods to analyze genome-scale profiles of cancer patients in search of better prognostic tests. </p>| <img align="right" src="/assets/images/Ted.jpg" height="202" width="200"> |
