## Welcome

My passions lie in leveraging science and mathematics to make discoveries from data that benefit humanity. Thanks for checking out my page, feel free to reach out if you'd like to talk more.

I am a Senior Data Scientist with experience in biomedical research, credit score, and marketing technologies. I've had great opportunities to work on numerous models, projects, analyses, and datasets to solve problems and build valuable products. I have product experience from building new products from concept through completion to saving floundering products. I'm comfortable interviewing and onboarding new team members along with communicating with stakeholders and executive leadership. Through these endeavors, I find myself drawn towards opportunities to build community, culture, and positive experiences. For example, I have created and seized opportunities to lead activities like lunch-and-learns and hackathons. I have built bridges to disparate parts of the organization and changed team culture from a burnout cycle to a supportive, sharing, and productive team. I am an optimist who sees the best in people and enjoys collaboration.

Most of all, I am a firm believer that <i>what</i> you do is only part of the picture. It's <i>how</i> you do it that can have so much more impact.
