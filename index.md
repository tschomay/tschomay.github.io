Hello! My name is Ted Schomay and I am a PhD student in Bioengineering at the University of Utah. My research is on developing mathematical frameworks to find patterns in big datasets. I use these methods to analyze genome-scale profiles of cancer patients in search of better prognostic tests. My passions lie in leveraging hard sciences and mathematics to make discoveries from data that benefit humanity. I recently started working as a Data Scientist with Progrexion, a leading credit repair company. In this role I use machine learning to find better ways to serve customers and decrease wasteful spending.
